## This should be my first real post. 

Still not entirely sure how to use Jekyll. Using Prose right now to make a post, and we'll see how it goes. Anyways, today is official Day 1 out of 147 of the blog. I have 147 days until I become a real working adult. If I think about it, I don't think I've had 147 free days since... I was very, very little.
